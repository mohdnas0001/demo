React CRUD Application with Authentication
This project is a simple React-based user interface for user registration, login, and item management (create, view, update, and delete operations). It also includes automated tests using Cypress for end-to-end testing and Jest for unit testing.

Features
User Authentication: Registration and login.
Item Management: View, create, update, and delete items.
Notification Messages: Displays success and error messages for user actions.
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm or Yarn for package management.
Backend Server with endpoints for authentication and item management.
Database (if required by the backend).

Project Setup
1. Backend Setup
The project requires a backend server for handling authentication and CRUD operations. If the backend is included within this repository, follow these instructions:


2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:


cd frontend

npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the frontend directory with the backend API URL:

env
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
Run the frontend application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Testing
This project uses Cypress for end-to-end testing and Jest for unit tests.

Cypress (End-to-End Tests)
Start the frontend and backend servers if they are not running.

npx cypress open
Run Tests: Select tests from the Cypress UI to run the end-to-end tests.
Jest (Unit Tests)
Run the unit tests:


npm test
Jest will automatically search for test files with .test.js or .spec.js extensions in the project.
